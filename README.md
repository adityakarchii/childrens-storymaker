## 🆘 Uh Oh, Something's Not Working?

Don't panic! Here are solutions to common hiccups:

### 😵 "The app won't start!"
- **Double-check**: Did you run `npm install` first?
- **Make sure**: Node.js is properly installed on your computer
- **Verify**: Your API key is correct and pasted properly
- **Try**: Restarting your computer (hey, it works more often than you'd think!)

### 📱 "I can't access the app in my browser!"

- **Try a different browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari - whatever you prefer!
- **Clear your browser cache**: Sometimes old data gets stuck

### 🤖 "Stories aren't generating!"
- **Test your internet**: AI needs to talk to Google's servers
- **Verify your API key**: Make sure it's working and not expired
- **Start simple**: Try "a happy cat" before "a complex philosophical tale"
- **Be patient**: Sometimes AI needs a moment to think!
